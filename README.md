# AUv3SequencerExample

This is an example Xcode project for creating an AUv3 MIDI sequencer for iOS or Mac. It contains a basic MIDI sequencing mechanism for sample-accurate sequencing and for safely passing data between non-realtime and realtime threads.

It is meant as example code for this [blog post](cp3.io/posts/sample-accurate-midi-timing).
